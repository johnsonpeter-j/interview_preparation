## âœ… JavaScript Mock Interview Q&A (MERN, 2.2 YOE)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Fundamentals

**Q1: What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**  
**A:**
- `var`: function-scoped, hoisted, can be re-declared.
- `let`: block-scoped, not hoisted to usable value, cannot be re-declared.
- `const`: block-scoped, must be initialized, cannot be reassigned.

**Q2: What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?**  
**A:** Truthy values evaluate to `true` in a Boolean context. Falsy values include: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.

**Q3: Explain the difference between `==` and `===`.**  
**A:** `==` allows type coercion, `===` checks both value and type (strict equality).

**Q4: What is hoisting? Which declarations are hoisted?**  
**A:** Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top. `var` and function declarations are hoisted; `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Functions & Scope

**Q5: What is a closure? Can you give a real-world use case?**  
**A:** A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope. Use case: private counters or factory functions.

**Q6: Whatâ€™s the difference between function declarations and expressions?**  
**A:** Declarations are hoisted, expressions are not.

**Q7: How does an arrow function handle the `this` keyword?**  
**A:** It uses `this` from the enclosing context (lexical scoping).

**Q8: What is the difference between a callback and a promise?**  
**A:** Callbacks are functions passed to other functions; promises represent future values with cleaner async handling.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Arrays & Objects

**Q9: What is the difference between `map` and `forEach`?**  
**A:** `map` returns a new array, `forEach` does not.

**Q10: How do you deep clone an object in JavaScript?**  
**A:** `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` or using structuredClone or libraries like Lodash.

**Q11: Can you write a function that removes duplicates from an array?**  
**A:**
```js
const removeDuplicates = arr => [...new Set(arr)];
```

**Q12: What does the `reduce()` function do? Give an example.**  
**A:** It accumulates values:
```js
const sum = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
```

### ðŸ”¹ 4. ES6+ Features

**Q13: What is destructuring and when would you use it?**  
**A:** It unpacks values from arrays or objects into variables.

**Q14: How do spread (`...`) and rest operators differ?**  
**A:** Spread expands; rest collects:
```js
const add = (...nums) => nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
```

**Q15: What is optional chaining (`?.`) and how is it helpful?**  
**A:** It avoids errors when accessing deeply nested properties.

**Q16: What are template literals?**  
**A:** String interpolation with backticks:
```js
`Hello, ${name}`
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Asynchronous JavaScript

**Q17: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code.**  
**A:** Synchronous blocks execution; async allows non-blocking operations like network calls.

**Q18: What is the purpose of `async/await`?**  
**A:** To write asynchronous code in a cleaner, more readable way.

**Q19: What happens if you forget to use `await` in an async function?**  
**A:** It returns a Promise instead of the resolved value.

**Q20: What does `Promise.all()` do?**  
**A:** Runs multiple promises in parallel and resolves when all succeed.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. DOM & Events

**Q21: How would you add a click event listener to a button in vanilla JS?**  
**A:**
```js
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => alert('Clicked'));
```

**Q22: What is event delegation?**  
**A:** Attaching a single event listener to a parent to handle child elements.

**Q23: What are synthetic events in React?**  
**A:** A wrapper over native events to ensure cross-browser consistency.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. `this`, Bind/Call/Apply

**Q24: What does `this` refer to in different contexts?**  
**A:** Depends on how the function is called. In a method, it refers to the object. In a regular function or global scope, it refers to the global object.

**Q25: How do `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` work?**  
**A:**
- `call`: calls a function with a given `this` and args.
- `apply`: same as `call`, but args in array.
- `bind`: returns a new function with bound `this`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Execution Context & Event Loop

**Q26: What is the JavaScript execution context and call stack?**  
**A:** It's the environment in which code is evaluated. The call stack manages function execution order.

**Q27: How does the event loop work in JavaScript?**  
**A:** It handles async callbacks by queuing them after the main thread is free.

**Q28: What will the output be?**
```js
console.log('1');
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));
console.log('4');
```
**A:**
```
1
4
3
2
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Object-Oriented JavaScript

**Q29: How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?**  
**A:** Using `class` and `extends`, or through prototypes.

**Q30: What are prototypes?**  
**A:** Objects from which other objects inherit methods and properties.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. Error Handling & Best Practices

**Q31: How does `try/catch` work?**  
**A:** It catches runtime errors in the `try` block and handles them in the `catch` block.

**Q32: What is the difference between `throw` and `return`?**  
**A:** `throw` generates an error; `return` exits the function with a value.

**Q33: What strategies do you follow to write clean and readable JS code?**  
**A:** Use meaningful names, modular code, avoid side effects, follow ESLint rules, comment complex logic.
