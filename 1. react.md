## âœ… React JS Developer - Full Revision with Questions & Answers (MERN, 2.2 YOE)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. React Core

**Q1: What is JSX and how does it differ from HTML?**  
**A:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. Unlike HTML, JSX requires closing tags and expressions are written inside `{}`.

**Q2: Difference between functional and class components?**  
**A:** Functional components are plain JavaScript functions using hooks, while class components use ES6 classes with lifecycle methods.

**Q3: How do you pass data between components?**  
**A:** Via `props` for child components; use callback props or context for sending data back up or globally.

**Q4: State vs Props?**  
**A:** `State` is internal and mutable; `props` are external and read-only.

**Q5: Handling events in React?**  
**A:** Use camelCase (e.g., `onClick`) and bind to functions inside the component.

**Q6: What happens when state changes?**  
**A:** React re-renders the component and its children where the state was updated.

**Q7: Component mounting phase?**  
**A:** It occurs when the component is created and inserted into the DOM (`useEffect` with empty deps).

### ðŸ”¹ 2. React Hooks

**Q8: Purpose of `useState`?**  
**A:** To add local state to functional components.

**Q9: How does `useEffect` work?**  
**A:** It runs side effects after render; it can depend on values to control when it runs.

**Q10: When to use `useContext`?**  
**A:** When you need to pass data deeply through components without prop drilling.

**Q11: What is `useRef` used for?**  
**A:** To persist values across renders without causing re-renders; also for DOM references.

**Q12: When to use `useMemo` and `useCallback`?**  
**A:** `useMemo` memoizes values; `useCallback` memoizes functions â€” both for optimization.

**Q13: Creating a custom hook?**  
**A:** Extract logic using other hooks into a reusable function starting with `use`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Component Architecture

**Q14: Presentational vs Container components?**  
**A:** Presentational handles UI, container handles logic and data fetching.

**Q15: Folder structure for scalable apps?**  
**A:** Organize by feature or module (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/pages`, `/store`, etc.).

**Q16: What is prop drilling?**  
**A:** Passing props through intermediate components; solved using Context API.

**Q17: Lifting state vs Context?**  
**A:** Lifting is local scope sharing; context is for global sharing across trees.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Routing

**Q18: How to define routes?**  
**A:** Use `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components from `react-router-dom`.

**Q19: Nested routes?**  
**A:** Define child routes inside a parent `<Route>` using `Outlet`.

**Q20: Private route example?**  
**A:** Wrap component in an auth check: `{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />}`

**Q21: Programmatic navigation?**  
**A:** Use `useNavigate()` and call `navigate('/route')`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. State Management

**Q22: Why Redux Toolkit?**  
**A:** Simplifies Redux boilerplate, includes slices, thunk, and dev tools by default.

**Q23: Creating a slice?**  
**A:** Use `createSlice()` with name, initialState, reducers.

**Q24: Dispatching async actions?**  
**A:** Use `createAsyncThunk()` for API calls and handle `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`.

**Q25: Redux vs Context?**  
**A:** Redux is scalable for complex state, Context is simple and good for limited use.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. API Integration

**Q26: Fetching data?**  
**A:** Use `axios.get()` or `fetch` inside `useEffect()`.

**Q27: Handling loading/error?**  
**A:** Use local state to track loading, success, and error messages.

**Q28: API calls in useEffect?**  
**A:** Define async function inside `useEffect` and call it immediately.

**Q29: Debouncing API calls?**  
**A:** Use `setTimeout` or libraries like `lodash.debounce` inside `useEffect`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Forms & Validation

**Q30: Controlled vs Uncontrolled?**  
**A:** Controlled: React controls input state. Uncontrolled: Uses refs and DOM state.

**Q31: Form submission?**  
**A:** Prevent default and handle logic in a submit handler.

**Q32: Manual validation?**  
**A:** Check values in `onSubmit`, show errors with conditions.

**Q33: React Hook Form?**  
**A:** Provides register, validation, and error management with minimal re-renders.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Performance

**Q34: Preventing re-renders?**  
**A:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and avoid state changes unless necessary.

**Q35: What is React.memo?**  
**A:** A HOC that skips re-rendering if props haven't changed.

**Q36: Code splitting?**  
**A:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when needed.

**Q37: useMemo use case?**  
**A:** For expensive calculations that should only recompute on deps change.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Testing Basics

**Q38: Testing with React Testing Library?**  
**A:** Use `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, `userEvent` to simulate user interactions.

**Q39: Mocking API calls?**  
**A:** Use `jest.mock()` or tools like `msw` to mock API responses.

**Q40: Unit vs Integration testing?**  
**A:** Unit: test individual pieces. Integration: test how pieces work together.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. MERN Integration

**Q41: Connecting React to Express?**  
**A:** Use `axios` to make requests to backend API (running on separate port).

**Q42: CRUD operations?**  
**A:** Use HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE via `axios`.

**Q43: JWT Auth?**  
**A:** Backend issues JWT, frontend stores in localStorage or cookie, sends in headers.

**Q44: Handling CORS?**  
**A:** Enable CORS in Express using `cors` middleware (`app.use(cors())`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 11. Git & Version Control

**Q45: Merge conflicts?**  
**A:** Happens on conflicting changes. Resolve manually and commit resolved state.

**Q46: Branching/Merging?**  
**A:** Use `git checkout -b feature` and `git merge feature` into main.

**Q47: Git pull vs fetch?**  
**A:** `pull` = fetch + merge. `fetch` only downloads without merge.

**Q48: Commit messages?**  
**A:** Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 12. Deployment

**Q49: Deploying React app?**  
**A:** Build using `npm run build`, upload to Vercel, Netlify, or FTP.

**Q50: Env variables?**  
**A:** Prefix with `REACT_APP_` and access via `process.env.REACT_APP_*`

**Q51: Full MERN deployment?**  
**A:** Host backend (e.g., on Render), frontend (Netlify), connect via URLs.

**Q52: Frontend-backend integration in prod?**  
**A:** Ensure correct base URLs, proxy setup, and CORS allowed in backend.
